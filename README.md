# IESopt stratified thermal storage (STS) example

This is based on the description in the [oemof docs](https://oemof-thermal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stratified_thermal_storage.html).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the resulting folder with VSCode
3. Launch a new Julia REPL (`Alt+J` then `Alt+O`)
4. Make sure the correct Julia environment is activated - run `] activate .` in the REPL
5. Install the required packages - run `] instantiate` in the REPL

Then you can execute the code in `main.jl` (`Shift + Enter`) executes lines directly in the REPL).
